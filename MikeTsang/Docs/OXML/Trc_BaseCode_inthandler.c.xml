     This function handles low priority interrupts.

 None.

<remarks >

     If you want to use these external low priority interrupts or any of the
     peripheral interrupts then you must enable them in your initialization
     routine. Innovation First, Inc. will not provide support for using these
     interrupts, so be careful. There is great potential for glitchy code if good
     interrupt programming practices are not followed. Especially read p. 28 of
     the "MPLAB(R) C18 C Compiler User's Guide" for information on context saving.
