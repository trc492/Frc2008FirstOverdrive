This project contains version 2.0 of the "streamlined" edition of
the IFI default code with CMUcam2 support. Differences from 1.0 are:

tracking.c/.h:
  Provided two new functions to set the pan and tilt servo position.
  This was done to provide a level of indirection so that the servos 
  could be controlled from the robot controller or the CMUcam2.

  Fixed bug in search initialization code where temp_pan_servo was
  initialized to zero instead of Tracking_Config_Data.Pan_Min_PWM.

  Altered tracking algorithm to use the t-packet confidence value to
  determine whether the code should track or search.

  Added Get_Tracking_State() function, which can be used to determine 
  if the camera is pointing at the target.

terminal.c:
  Added "no camera data" diagnostic information.

user_routines.c:
  Added code to send tracking state information to the user LEDs on
  the operator interface.
